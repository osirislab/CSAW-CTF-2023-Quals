Dear Hudson Hustles Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Jane Smith, and I recently had the pleasure of experiencing one of your jet ski tours on the Hudson River. While the overall experience was enjoyable, I do have a few questions and concerns I'd like to address.

1. Safety Measures:
   Firstly, I'd like to inquire about the safety measures in place during the jet ski tours. I noticed that some participants were not wearing life jackets consistently throughout the trip. Could you please provide more information on your safety protocols and how they are enforced?

2. Equipment Condition:
   During the tour, I encountered some technical issues with the jet ski I was assigned. The engine seemed to sputter at times, which made me a bit uneasy. Can you clarify your maintenance procedures and how often the jet skis are inspected for safety and performance?

3. Tour Duration:
   I thoroughly enjoyed the tour, but it felt a bit shorter than I had expected. Could you provide more details on the typical duration of your tours, including any available options for longer excursions?

4. Life of Dice:
   Lastly, I have a unique question unrelated to jet skis. I'm curious about the "Life of Dice" and how it's related to your business. Could you please explain this concept?

I appreciate your prompt attention to these inquiries and concerns. It's essential for me to understand these aspects better for future visits and to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants.
