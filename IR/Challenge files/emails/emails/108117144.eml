Dear Hudson Hustles Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sarah Anderson, and I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a thrilling jet ski adventure with your company on the Hudson River. While I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I am writing to express some concerns regarding the charges incurred during my visit.

Upon reviewing my credit card statement, I noticed that I was billed double the amount that was initially quoted to me for the jet ski rental. I booked a single jet ski for a two-hour ride, which was supposed to cost $150 according to your website. However, my credit card was charged $300 for the same rental.

I would like to request an explanation for this discrepancy and seek a resolution to this matter. I believe there might have been an error in the billing process or a misunderstanding regarding the pricing. It's essential for me to clarify this issue promptly, as the double charge has caused some financial inconvenience.

To help you investigate this matter, I have attached a copy of my reservation confirmation and the credit card statement showing the double charge.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience how this issue will be addressed. I can be reached at senderemail@example.com or by phone at (555) 123-4567.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and hope for a swift resolution.

Sincerely,

Sarah Anderson
