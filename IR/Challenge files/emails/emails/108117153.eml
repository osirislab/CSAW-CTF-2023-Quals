Dear Hudson Hustles Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Emily Thompson, and I recently had the pleasure of experiencing your jet ski services on the Hudson River. I wanted to reach out to you with an enquiry and a small concern regarding the fuel levels of the jet skis I rented.

Firstly, I'd like to express my appreciation for the fantastic time I had on the Hudson River. Your team provided excellent service, and the jet ski adventure was truly memorable.

However, during the excursion, I couldn't help but notice that the fuel level in the jet ski I was riding never seemed to reach a full level. It felt like the tank was not completely filled when I started, which made me a bit anxious during the ride. I understand that fuel levels can vary, but it seemed to consume fuel faster than expected.

Could you please provide some clarification on how the fuel levels are managed and whether there was a specific reason for not filling the tank to its maximum capacity? I'd like to better understand this aspect of your service for future reference.

Furthermore, if there are any tips or guidelines you can offer to maximize the fuel efficiency of the jet skis, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Emily Thompson
