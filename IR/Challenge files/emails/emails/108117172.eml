Dear Hudson Hustles Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Alex Thompson, and I recently had the pleasure of experiencing one of your jet ski tours on the Hudson River. Overall, it was an exhilarating and enjoyable experience, and I appreciate the effort your team puts into these recreations.

However, I wanted to bring up a concern regarding the ski height during the tour. It seemed to me that the jet ski I was assigned had its ski set too high. This caused a few issues during the ride, primarily in terms of stability and control. I felt that the ski height made the jet ski less responsive and, at times, even a bit unsafe.

I understand that safety is a top priority for your company, and I appreciate that. Still, I believe it's essential to ensure that all the equipment is properly maintained and adjusted for the best possible experience. While I don't have any expertise in jet ski mechanics, I thought it would be useful to share my experience as a participant.

I trust that you will look into this matter and take any necessary steps to ensure the ski heights are set correctly on all your jet skis. I believe this will enhance the overall experience for your customers and maintain your excellent reputation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you regarding any actions taken or any insights you can provide on the ski height adjustment.

Best regards,

Alex Thompson
