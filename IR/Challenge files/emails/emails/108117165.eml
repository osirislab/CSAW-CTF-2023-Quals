Dear Hudson Hustles Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Emily Johnson, and I am writing to you with a rather unusual but curious question. I recently took one of your exhilarating Jet Ski tours on the Hudson River and had an amazing time! Your team provided excellent service, and the experience was truly unforgettable.

However, during the tour, a question popped into my mind that I couldn't shake off: "Why is the sky blue?" I know it might sound unrelated to Jet Skis and river adventures, but I thought your team might have some insights or knowledge to share. It's been bothering me, and I figured you guys might have some interesting information to help satisfy my curiosity.

If you have a moment to spare, I would greatly appreciate it if you could shed some light on this question. Of course, I understand that your primary focus is on providing fantastic water-based experiences, but any information or explanation you can provide would be fantastic.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you, and I can't wait to join another one of your thrilling Jet Ski tours soon!

Best regards,
Emily Johnson
